# Friendly-XML
A basic xml parser/serializer inspired by PHP's SimpleXML

This is a basic sax-js based xml parser which converts an xml formatted string into a sensible json object which can be used to locate xml values, edit xml values, and serialize json objects back into an xml string. This is more for basic xml parsing, it may not be super stable for more advanced scenarios as I'm not an expert in the uses xml but it should work for the purposes of basic xml reading/manipulation

# Installation

	npm install friendly-xml

# Methods

	ParseString( xml_string, callback );

(xml_string: string) - an xml formatted string

(callback: json_object->void) - a function which takes one argument which will be the resulting json object passed from the parser or null if the parser failed to read the supplied string

---
	
	asXML( json_object );

Returns an xml formatted string based on a json object. ( ie. json_object )

# Parsing Usage

Parsing is done in the expected way

	var FXML = require('friendly-xml');

	FXML.ParseString( xml_string, function( result )
	{
		//Result will be json object
		if( result != null ) { console.log( result ); }
	} );

# JSON Manipulation

Any actual xml values will be put in the "val" field. Any other xml attributes will be under their respective name.
Assuming the following xml:

	<Library>
	  <book Genre="horror">
			<Title>IT</Title>
	  </book>
	</Library>

The JSON object can be manipulated as follows:

	FXML.ParseString( xml_string, function( result )
	{
		if( result.Library.book.Genre == "Horror" )
			console.log( result.Library.book.Title.val + " is a horror book!" );
			
		  result.Library.book.Title.val = "The Jungle Book";
		  result.Library.book.Genre = "Disney";
		  
		  //Or Alternatively
		  
		  result['Library']['book']['Title']['val'] = "The Jungle Book";
		  result['Library']['book']['Genre'] = "Disney";
		  
		  console.log( FXML.asXML( result ) );
	} );

The above would output:

	IT is a horror book!

	<Library>
	  <book Genre="Disney">
		<Title>The Jungle Book</Title>
	  </book>
	</Library>

( I realize "Disney" isn't actually a genre. Im tired huh? Been a long day )

## Arrays
If the xml has a repeating tag, it will be converted to an array

Assuming the following xml:

	<Movies>
		<Favorites>
			<Title Genre="Magic">Harry Potter 1</Title>
			<Title Genre="Magic">Chronicles Of Narnia</Title>
			<Title Genre="Action">Lethal Weapon</Title>
		</Favorites>
	</Movies>

It can be used in this way:

	FXML.ParseString( xml_string, function( result )
	{
		//Has same val property and attributes as other singular nodes 
		//i.e: result.Movies.Favorites.Title[0].val
		//i.e: result.Movies.Favorites.Title[0].Genre

		result.Movies.Favorites.Title.forEach( movie => {
			console.log( movie.Genre )
			console.log( movie.Val )
		});
	} );

Hopefully someone finds this to be of use!
